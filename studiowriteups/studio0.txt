Question PS5: 
	
Question A1:
	After the first two ticks, the graph generally follows a consistent horizontal linear pattern.
	This suggests that there is a constant function in our code that would create this pattern.Same amount of ticks for 
	each iteration.
Question A2: The data tells us that there is a linear function available. The value of this.n is important in 
knowing how fast the function progresses. 
	
Question A3:The for loop makes the function run a constant number of times regardless of the functions occurring outside that parameter.
	
Question A4:ticker.ticks is reflecting the value of n each time, whereas the second graph is adding the numbers of the ticks. 

Question A5:the fewest number is 2, when tally has to make 2 marks and the decimal notation only needs one.log base 2n in binary.

Question A6: Um.

Question A7:difference between decimal and binary doesnt matter as much. Thus it is more important to choose binary or decimal over unary
	
Question C1:Constant time for both, second one less wobbly
